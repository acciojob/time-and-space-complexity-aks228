	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a way to measure how the running time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input grows efficient describes how fast an algorithm runs as the input size increases, helping us measure its efficiency</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> In simple terms, it tells you how much extra space your algorithm requires, aside from the input data, as the input size grows  O(n)As input increases</p>
